# Work1: Natural Health Website System

## Project Summary
Work1 is a comprehensive web application project that demonstrates building a production-ready, full-stack health and wellness platform. The system provides users with a searchable database of natural ingredients, complete with detailed information on benefits, nutrition facts, risks, warnings, and usage recommendations. Featuring a modern tech stack (FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL) and cloud deployment (AWS), this project serves as both a functional application blueprint and a comprehensive learning resource for software development methodologies.

**Current Focus**: Version 1.0.0 implementation using the Dann Framework - a question-first, solo-developer-friendly approach to software development that emphasizes thorough planning, documentation, and iterative improvement.

## Repository Purpose & Goal
This repository serves dual purposes:
1. **Implementation Blueprint**: Provides step-by-step instructions, code structures, and deployment guides for building a complete health information system
2. **Learning Framework**: Demonstrates the Dann Framework methodology through extensive documentation, version planning, and SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) practices

The ultimate goal is to create a scalable, accessible platform that empowers users to make informed decisions about natural health and nutrition, while establishing a replicable framework for future solo software development projects.

## Current Status
**Version 0.0.0** - Planning and Documentation Phase

The project is currently in documentation development. Once implementation begins following the version guides, the version will increment based on progress (e.g., completing "Stage 2, Sub-Stage 1" of Version 1.0.0 would advance to Version 1.2.1).

*Last documented update: Version 1.0.0 development stages fully detailed with UI setup and AWS deployment guides.*

## Documentation Guide
This repository provides comprehensive documentation structured for systematic development:

### Reading Order:
1. **Dann Framework Documentation** (`Docs/DannFramework_docs/`) - Start here (Phases 1-8)
   - Phase 1: Project Planning & Problem Definition
   - Phase 2: Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
   - Phase 3: Software Design
   - Phase 4: System Modeling (UML)
   - Phase 5: SDLC Strategy
   - Phase 6: Deployment, Operations & Cost
   - Phase 7: Maintenance & Sustainability
   - Phase 8: Final Review Checklist

2. **Version Implementation Guides** (`Docs/Versions/`)
   - Version 1.md: Detailed 6-stage development pipeline
   - Each version provides step-by-step instructions for complete implementation

### Key Documentation Concepts:
- **Phases** provide the framework methodology and conceptual guidance
- **Versions** contain practical implementation instructions with code examples
- Start with Phases to understand the "why", then use Versions for the "how"
