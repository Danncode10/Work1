# **PHASE 5 — SDLC Strategy**

## **5.1 SDLC Selection**

* **Is the scope stable?**
  Partially — core Version 1 features are defined, but future features (AI, mobile, advanced recipes) are flexible.

* **Is feedback frequent?**
  Yes — co-founders (doctor and manager) will provide ongoing feedback during development.

* **Is risk high?**
  Moderate — technical risk is manageable for Version 1, but future AI integration and scaling introduce higher risk.

* **Selected SDLC Approach:**
  **Waterfall planning** for upfront requirements and SRS documentation
  **Agile development** for rapid iteration and feedback
  **Incremental releases** to deploy Version 1 quickly and add features progressively
