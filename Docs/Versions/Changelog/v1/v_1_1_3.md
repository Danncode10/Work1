# Version 1.1.3: Prepare Environment Variables (Partial Completion Documentation)

## What We Did

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated `Docs/Versions/Version 1.md` to reflect partial completion status of Stage 1.3
- ✅ Added clarification note: "(Partially Complete - Placeholders Used)"
- ✅ Updated bullet point descriptions to specify which values were actually populated vs. placeholders

### Environment Variables Status
- ✅ Verified `.env.example` already exists and matches Phase 2 SRS requirements
- ✅ Confirmed `.env` file was created with partial values:
  - AWS_REGION, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Populated with actual development values
  - DATABASE_URL, AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID, AWS_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID: Using placeholder values
  - NODE_ENV, PORT, REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL: Populated with standard development values

## Key Decisions Made
- **Partial Completion Approach**: Instead of marking as fully complete, documented the actual state with placeholders for values not yet available (database and Cognito setup pending later stages)
- **Placeholder Strategy**: Used descriptive placeholder text (e.g., "your-cognito-user-pool-id") instead of empty values to make requirements clear
- **Status Indicator**: Adopted 🔶 symbol for partial completion to distinguish from ✅ (complete) and potential ❌ (not started)

## Detailed Explanations

### Modified Files
**Docs/Versions/Version 1.md**
- Changed stage header from:
  ```
  1.3 ✅ Sub Stage: **Prepare Environment Variables**
  ```
  to:
  ```
  1.3 🔶 Sub Stage: **Prepare Environment Variables** (Partially Complete - Placeholders Used)
  ```
- Updated second bullet point from:
  ```
  - Populate a local `.env` file with development-specific values.
  ```
  to:
  ```
  - Populate a local `.env` file with development-specific values (only AWS credentials updated; database and Cognito IDs use placeholders pending later stages).
  ```

### Environment Variables Strategy
- **Immediate Values**: AWS credentials, NODE_ENV, PORT, REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL were populated since they're either known or standard development defaults
- **Pending Values**: DATABASE_URL requires Stage 2.1 (PostgreSQL setup), Cognito IDs require Stage 3.2 (AWS Cognito configuration)
- **Placeholder Format**: Used consistent "your-*" format for AWS service IDs to indicate they need actual values from AWS console

## Current Status
- Stage 1.3 Sub Stage: Prepare Environment Variables partially completed
- `.env.example` verified and complete
- `.env` file created with mix of actual values and placeholders
- Development environment ready for next stages (database and Cognito setup)
- AWS credentials properly configured for development work

## Files/Configurations Updated
- `Docs/Versions/Version 1.md` - Updated status and descriptions for Stage 1.3

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Stage 2.1: Set up Local PostgreSQL Database
- Replace DATABASE_URL placeholder with actual local PostgreSQL connection string
- Continue with database schema definition and initial data population
- Later update Cognito placeholders when reaching Stage 3.2
