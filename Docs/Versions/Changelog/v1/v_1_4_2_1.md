# Version 1.4.2.1: Install React Router Dependencies

## Date
12/19/2025

## What We Did

### Environment Setup
- No new environment setup required - used existing Node.js/npm environment

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `Docs/Versions/Version 1.md` - Marked sub-stage 4.2.1 checkbox as completed ([x])

### Files Created/Modified
- Modified `ui/package.json` - Added react-router-dom dependency
- Modified `ui/package-lock.json` - Updated lock file with new dependency versions

## Detailed Explanations

### What is React Router DOM?
React Router DOM is like a traffic controller for your React application. Imagine your website as a building with multiple rooms (pages). Without React Router, users would have to refresh the entire page to go from one "room" to another, which is slow and disruptive. React Router allows users to move between pages instantly without refreshing, creating a smooth single-page application experience.

### Why Do We Need It?
For the Natural Health website, users need to navigate between:
- Home page (/)
- Ingredients list (/ingredients)
- Individual ingredient details (/ingredients/:id)
- Login and registration pages (/login, /register)

React Router DOM provides the tools to handle these URL changes and render the correct components without page refreshes.

### Files Modified

**ui/package.json**
- Added `"react-router-dom": "^6.22.3"` to the dependencies section
- This tells npm what packages to install and their versions
- The ^ symbol allows compatible updates (like 6.23.x but not 7.x.x)

**ui/package-lock.json**
- Updated automatically by npm to lock exact versions
- Ensures everyone gets identical package versions
- Prevents "works on my machine" issues in team development

**Docs/Versions/Version 1.md**
- Changed checkbox from `[ ]` to `[x]` for sub-stage 4.2.1
- Indicates this installation step is complete

### Technical Details
- **Version Installed**: react-router-dom@6.22.3 (latest stable v6)
- **Installation Method**: npm install (standard Node.js package manager)
- **Package Size**: Lightweight, focused on routing functionality
- **Compatibility**: Works with React 18+ (our current version)

### Why This Matters for Beginners
Think of npm install like going to a store to buy ingredients for cooking. You're telling the store "I need react-router-dom" and npm goes out, finds it, downloads it, and puts it in your kitchen (node_modules folder). Now you have all the tools needed to build the routing system for your website.

## Usage Instructions

### Verifying the Installation
1. Navigate to the ui directory:
   ```
   cd ui
   ```

2. Check if the package is installed:
   ```
   npm list react-router-dom
   ```

3. You should see: `react-router-dom@6.22.3`

### Configuration
- No additional configuration needed at this step
- The package is ready to use in your React components
- Will be imported and used in the next sub-stage (4.2.2)

### Testing
- The installation is confirmed by npm's successful completion
- No runtime testing needed at this step
- Router setup and functionality will be tested in subsequent sub-stages

## Current Status
- React Router DOM dependency successfully installed
- Package.json and package-lock.json updated
- Documentation checkbox marked as completed
- Ready to proceed with router configuration

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Sub-stage 4.2.2: Set Up Main Router Structure
- Create router configuration in App.jsx
- Define routes for all application pages
- Set up route components and navigation
