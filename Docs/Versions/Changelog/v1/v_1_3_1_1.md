# Version 1.3.1.1: Add Database Dependencies

## Date
12/18/2025

## What We Did

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Installed Poetry package manager using pip
- ✅ Initialized Poetry project in backend directory with `poetry init --no-interaction`
- ✅ Added database-related dependencies: FastAPI, Uvicorn, asyncpg, SQLAlchemy

### Documentation Updates
- None

### Files Created/Modified
- Created `backend/pyproject.toml` - Poetry project configuration file
- Created `backend/poetry.lock` - Lock file with exact dependency versions

## Detailed Explanations

### Poetry Installation and Initialization
- **Poetry Installation**: Used `pip install poetry` to install the Poetry tool, which manages Python dependencies and virtual environments
- **Project Initialization**: Ran `poetry init --no-interaction` to create `pyproject.toml` with default Python project settings
- **Virtual Environment**: Poetry automatically created a virtual environment in `/Users/lesterdannlopez/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs` to isolate project dependencies

### Dependency Additions
- **FastAPI (^0.125.0)**: Think of this as a toolkit for building the "brain" of our website - it helps create the code that handles requests from users (like when someone searches for ingredients). It's modern and fast, using Python's type system to make coding easier and safer.
- **Uvicorn (^0.38.0)**: This is like the "engine" that runs our FastAPI code. It starts the web server that makes our backend available online, handling multiple requests at the same time without slowing down.
- **asyncpg (^0.31.0)**: A fast "driver" that lets our Python code talk to the PostgreSQL database. It's asynchronous, meaning it can handle database operations without blocking other tasks, like serving web pages while saving data.
- **SQLAlchemy (^2.0.45)**: A powerful library that acts as a translator between our Python code and the database. Instead of writing raw SQL commands, we can use Python objects and methods, making database operations feel like working with regular Python code.
- **Additional Dependencies**: Poetry automatically installed helper libraries that these main tools need to work. For example, pydantic helps validate data (like checking if an email is valid), and starlette provides the foundation that FastAPI builds upon.

### Technical Details
- **Dependency Resolution**: Poetry resolved and installed 15 packages total, ensuring compatibility between all libraries
- **Lock File**: `poetry.lock` ensures reproducible builds by locking exact versions of all dependencies and sub-dependencies
- **Virtual Environment Isolation**: All packages installed in the project's virtual environment, preventing conflicts with system Python packages

## Usage Instructions

### Setup Steps
1. Ensure Poetry is installed: `pip install poetry` (if not already done)
2. Navigate to backend directory: `cd backend`
3. Activate virtual environment: `poetry shell` (optional, Poetry can run commands directly)
4. Dependencies are already installed and ready to use

### Configuration
- No additional configuration needed at this stage
- Environment variables for database connection will be configured in the next steps

### Testing
- Verify installation: `poetry show` (lists installed packages)
- Test FastAPI: Create a simple test file to ensure imports work

## Current Status
- Database dependencies successfully installed and configured
- Backend project ready for database connection implementation
- Virtual environment set up with all required packages

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 2: Configure database connection settings using environment variables
- Create database configuration module in `backend/app/core/`
- Set up SQLAlchemy engine and session management
