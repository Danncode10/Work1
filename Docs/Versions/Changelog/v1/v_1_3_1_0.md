# Version 1.3.1: Initialize FastAPI Project Structure

## Date
12/18/2025

## What We Did

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Created backend project directory structure with Poetry for dependency management
- ✅ Initialized Poetry project in backend directory

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Moved Stage 2.4 (Database Connection & ORM) to Stage 3.1.1 for correct sequence
- ✅ Marked Stage 3.1 as completed in Version 1.md

### Files Created/Modified
- Created `backend/` directory
- Created `backend/app/` package with subdirectories: `api/`, `models/`, `crud/`, `core/`
- Created `backend/pyproject.toml` via Poetry init

## Detailed Explanations

### Documentation Sequence Fix
- **Rationale**: Stage 2.4 required integrating into the backend, but backend structure wasn't initialized yet. Moved it to 3.1.1 to follow logical order: create structure first, then add database connection.
- **Changes Made**: Removed 2.4 from Stage 2, inserted as 3.1.1 after 3.1 in Version 1.md. Updated status indicator for 3.1 to ✅.

### Backend Project Initialization
- **Directory Structure**: Created `backend/app/` with modular subdirectories following FastAPI best practices:
  - `api/` - For API route definitions
  - `models/` - For database models (SQLAlchemy)
  - `crud/` - For Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
  - `core/` - For core functionality like config and security
- **Poetry Setup**: Used `poetry init --no-interaction` to create `pyproject.toml` with default Python project configuration. Poetry manages dependencies and virtual environments as specified in Stage 1.1.

### Technical Details
- **Project Layout**: Follows the structure outlined in Version 1.md Stage 3.1, providing a foundation for FastAPI application development.
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry initialized with default settings; ready to add FastAPI, asyncpg, and other dependencies in next stages.

## Current Status
- Backend project structure fully initialized and ready for development
- Documentation updated to reflect correct stage sequence
- Poetry configured for dependency management

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Stage 3.1.1: Implement Database Connection & ORM
- Add FastAPI and database dependencies via Poetry
- Create SQLAlchemy models for users and ingredients tables
