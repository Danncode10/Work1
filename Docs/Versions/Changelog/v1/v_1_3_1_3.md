# v_1_3_1_3: Add Development Script Documentation (Failed Attempts)

## Stage 3.1.1.3: Add Development Script for Running the Server (🔶 Partially Complete)

### Intended Outcome:
To provide a convenient `poetry run dev` command that starts the FastAPI development server with auto-reload, replacing the longer `poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload` command.

### Failed Attempts and Observations:

Several attempts were made to implement this, but persistent issues prevented successful execution of the `dev` script.

1.  **Initial Plan:** Modify `backend/pyproject.toml` to include:
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.scripts]
    dev = "uvicorn app.main:app --reload"
    ```
    *   **Result:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn app'`

2.  **Refinement 1:** Changed the script to use `python -m uvicorn`, which is often more robust for module execution:
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.scripts]
    dev = "python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload"
    ```
    *   **Result:** Still encountered `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uvicorn app'`.

3.  **Refinement 2:** Added `package-mode = false` under `[tool.poetry]` in `backend/pyproject.toml` to prevent Poetry from attempting to install the project as a package:
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry]
    # ...
    package-mode = false
    ```
    *   **Result (after `poetry install`):** The `poetry install` command itself would sometimes report `"No file/folder found for package non-package-mode"` or similar messages, indicating Poetry was still trying to interpret the project as an installable package despite `package-mode = false`. This led to the `dev` script failing with the `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### Conclusion:
The `dev` script for easily launching the backend server is not yet functional due to unresolved issues with Poetry's environment setup and package recognition for this project structure. This stage remains partially complete (🔶) and will be addressed in a future iteration. The `pyproject.toml` file currently contains the `package-mode = false` and the `dev = "python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload"` script, but these changes have not yet resolved the underlying Poetry issues.
