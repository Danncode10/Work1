# Version 1.5.1.0: Enable IAM User Console Access

## Date
12/24/2025

## What We Did

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Enabled console access for the "naturalhealth-admin" IAM user in AWS Management Console
- ✅ Set a password for the IAM user to allow web-based AWS access
- ✅ Logged into AWS Management Console using the IAM user credentials
- ✅ Verified access to AWS services with limited permissions (following security best practices)

### Documentation Updates
- None

### Files Created/Modified
- None (changes made in AWS Management Console, not local files)

## Detailed Explanations

### Why We Enabled Console Access
Previously, the "naturalhealth-admin" IAM user only had programmatic access keys for use with AWS CLI and SDKs. However, for managing AWS resources through the web interface during development and deployment phases, console access was needed. This allows:

- Visual management of AWS services (EC2, RDS, S3, etc.)
- Easier monitoring and troubleshooting
- Access to services that don't have full CLI support
- Better user experience for ongoing AWS management tasks

### Security Considerations
**Why Use IAM User Instead of Root Account:**
- Root account has unlimited access to all AWS resources
- IAM users can be granted only necessary permissions (principle of least privilege)
- Better audit trail and access control
- Reduced risk if credentials are compromised

**Console Access vs Programmatic Access:**
- Programmatic access keys are for CLI/SDK automation
- Console access is for manual web-based management
- Both can be enabled independently for the same IAM user

### Steps to Enable Console Access

#### 1. Login as Administrator
- Access AWS Management Console with root account or admin IAM user
- Navigate to IAM service
- Find the "naturalhealth-admin" user

#### 2. Enable Console Password
- Go to "Security credentials" tab
- Under "Console password" section, click "Manage console access"
- Select "Enable console access"
- Choose password setting method:
  - Autogenerated password (AWS creates a temporary password)
  - Custom password (set your own)
- Optionally check "Require password reset" for first login

#### 3. Login with IAM User
- Use the account alias URL: https://admin-dann.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
- Enter username: naturalhealth-admin
- Enter the password set in step 2
- If "Require password reset" was checked, you'll be prompted to change the password

### Current IAM User Permissions
The "naturalhealth-admin" user has permissions appropriate for this project's development and deployment needs, including access to:
- EC2 (for servers)
- RDS (for databases)
- S3 (for storage)
- CloudWatch (for monitoring)
- IAM (for managing roles and policies)

Permissions are limited to what's needed for the NutriFriendly project, not full admin access.

### Account Alias
The AWS account uses the alias "admin-dann" for easier login URLs. This alias was set during initial account setup and appears in console login URLs.

## Usage Instructions

### Logging into AWS Console as IAM User
1. Open browser and go to: https://admin-dann.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
2. Enter username: `naturalhealth-admin`
3. Enter password (set during enablement)
4. If prompted, complete MFA (if enabled) or password reset
5. You'll be logged in with IAM user permissions

### Switching Between Accounts
- Use different browser tabs/windows for different AWS accounts/users
- Or use AWS account switcher in the console (if available)
- Always logout when done with admin/root access

### Best Practices for Console Usage
- Don't use console for automated tasks (use CLI/SDK instead)
- Enable MFA on IAM users for additional security
- Regularly rotate access keys and passwords
- Monitor AWS usage and costs through console dashboards

## Status/Next Steps

### Current Status
- ✅ IAM user console access enabled
- ✅ Password configured and tested
- ✅ Successful login to AWS Management Console verified
- ✅ Limited permissions confirmed (not full admin access)
- ✅ Ready for AWS resource management during deployment phases

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Stage 5: Deployment & Operations (AWS)
- Begin setting up AWS infrastructure (EC2, RDS, etc.)
- Configure production environment variables
- Deploy backend and frontend applications

## Notes
This step completes the AWS account preparation phase by enabling secure console access for development. The IAM user approach provides better security than using root credentials while still allowing necessary AWS management capabilities. Console access will be essential for the upcoming deployment stages where visual configuration and monitoring are required.

## How did we Test if the Code works:
- [x] Verified IAM user exists in AWS console
- [x] Confirmed console access was disabled initially
- [x] Enabled console access and set password
- [x] Successfully logged in using IAM user credentials
- [x] Tested access to basic AWS services (EC2, S3, etc.)
- [x] Verified permissions are limited (not full admin access)
