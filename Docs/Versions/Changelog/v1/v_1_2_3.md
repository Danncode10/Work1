# Version 1.2.3: Ingredient Data Sources & Trust Model Documentation

## What We Did

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Analyzed Stage 2.3 guidelines for ingredient data sourcing and trust model
- ✅ Created comprehensive developer guide for implementing trust model requirements
- ✅ Documented alternative approaches for future versions (API-assisted research)

### Files Created/Modified
- None (documentation of guidelines and processes)

## Detailed Explanations

### Trust Model Guidelines Analysis
- **Reputable Sources**: Identified approved sources including peer-reviewed journals, government databases, and recognized health organizations
- **Manual Curation Requirement**: Confirmed all data must be human-researched and verified, with no AI-generated content
- **Reference Standards**: Established format for citations in the `references` TEXT[] field with at least one authoritative source per ingredient

### Developer Implementation Guide
Created a step-by-step guide for developers to follow when curating ingredient data:
- Source evaluation checklist
- Data curation standards
- References field formatting
- Data entry workflow example
- SQL insertion example for turmeric ingredient

### Alternative Approaches (Future Scope)
- **API-Assisted Research**: Using USDA FoodData Central API and PubMed API for structured data retrieval
- **Semi-Automated Workflows**: Scripts for bulk import with manual review
- **Hybrid Process**: API fetching followed by human verification

All approaches maintain the core requirement of manual curation and trustworthiness.

## Current Status
- Stage 2.3 guidelines fully understood and documented
- Developer guide prepared for future data population tasks
- Trust model principles established for manual data curation
- Alternative approaches noted for potential future implementation (out of V1 scope)

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Stage 2.4: Implement Database Connection & ORM
- Set up FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL integration
- Create SQLAlchemy models and CRUD operations for ingredients
