# Version 1.5.3.1: Install Docker on EC2 Instance

## Date
12/24/2025

## What We Did

### Environment Setup
- ✅ Installed Docker Community Edition on Ubuntu EC2 instance
- ✅ Started Docker daemon service for container management
- ✅ Added ubuntu user to docker group for permission management
- ✅ Refreshed user session to activate group permissions
- ✅ Successfully tested Docker installation with hello-world container

### Documentation Updates
- None

### Files Created/Modified
- None (system-level installations only)

## Detailed Explanations

### Docker Installation Process

**Package Installation:**
- `sudo apt install docker.io -y` installs Docker Community Edition from Ubuntu repositories
- `-y` flag automatically confirms installation without user prompts
- Docker provides containerization platform for running applications in isolated environments

**Service Activation:**
- `sudo systemctl start docker` starts the Docker daemon (background service)
- Docker daemon manages container lifecycle, networking, and storage
- Required for creating and running Docker containers

**Permission Management:**
- `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` adds the ubuntu user to the docker group
- Docker group membership allows running docker commands without sudo
- Improves security by not requiring root privileges for container operations

**Session Refresh:**
- User logged out and SSH'd back in to activate group membership changes
- Group permissions don't take effect in active sessions
- Fresh login ensures docker commands work without sudo

### Docker Hello-World Test

**Container Execution:**
- `docker run hello-world` downloads and runs a test container from Docker Hub
- Hello-world is a minimal container that prints a success message
- Verifies complete Docker installation and functionality

**What the Test Proves:**
- Docker daemon is running and accessible
- Network connectivity to Docker Hub works
- Container creation, execution, and cleanup functions properly
- User has appropriate permissions to run containers

### Containerization Benefits

**Why Docker for Deployment:**
- **Consistency:** Applications run identically across different environments
- **Isolation:** Each application runs in its own container with dedicated resources
- **Portability:** Container images can be moved between development, testing, and production
- **Efficiency:** Lightweight compared to full virtual machines
- **Versioning:** Docker images are versioned and reproducible

**Future Usage:**
- FastAPI backend will run in a Docker container
- Easy scaling and updates through container management
- Simplified deployment compared to direct system installation
- Better resource utilization and security isolation

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Docker Commands
```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a

# View Docker images
docker images

# Remove unused containers
docker container prune

# Remove unused images
docker image prune
```

### Running Containers
```bash
# Run a container interactively
docker run -it ubuntu bash

# Run in background (detached)
docker run -d nginx

# Map container ports to host
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 myapp
```

## Status/Next Steps

### Current Status
- ✅ Docker Community Edition installed and configured
- ✅ Docker daemon running and accessible
- ✅ User permissions properly configured for docker group
- ✅ Container execution tested and verified working
- ✅ System ready for containerized application deployment

### Next Steps
- Install Node.js for frontend tooling and build processes
- Install Nginx web server for serving static content and reverse proxy
- Install Git for code repository cloning
- Install Python and pip for backend development
- Verify all installations work correctly
- Create Dockerfile for containerizing the FastAPI application

## Notes
Docker installation provides the foundation for modern containerized deployment. The hello-world test confirms that the container runtime is properly configured and can communicate with Docker Hub for image downloads. This setup enables reliable, reproducible application deployments that are independent of the host system's configuration.

## How did we Test if the Code works:
- [x] Docker package installed without errors
- [x] Docker service started successfully
- [x] User added to docker group without issues
- [x] SSH session refresh activated group permissions
- [x] docker run hello-world executed successfully
- [x] Hello-world container printed success message
- [x] Container cleanup completed automatically
- [x] Docker daemon remained running after test
